Lab 4: Measuring the cost of a system call
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lab, you'll empirically measure the costs of a system call,
and speculate on how you might measure the cost of a context switch.

Measuring the cost of a system call is *relatively* easy.  For
example, you could repeatedly call a really simple system call (e.g.,
performing a 0-byte read), and time how long it takes; dividing the
time by the number of iterations gives you a rough estimate of the
cost of a system call.

One thing you’ll have to take into account is the precision and
accuracy of your timer.  A typical timer that you can use is
``gettimeofday()``; a short example of using this call is given below,
but you should also consult the ``man`` page.  What you’ll see there
is that ``gettimeofday()`` returns the time in microseconds since
1970; however, this does not mean that the timer is precise to the
microsecond.  Measure back-to-back calls to ``gettimeofday()`` to
learn something about how precise the timer really is; this will tell
you how many iterations of your null system-call test you’ll have to
run in order to get a good measurement result.  If ``gettimeofday()``
is not precise enough for you, you might look into using the rdtsc
instruction available on x86 machines (a short example is given
below).  This instruction reads the current value of a cycle timer;
you’ll have to convert the results to seconds yourself of course.

You should measure two separate system calls; which two you
measure is entirely up to you, but they should reasonably
different types of calls.  Here are just some of the
possibilities: ``stat()``, ``read()``, ``write()``, ``getpid()``,
``gethostname()``, ``gettimeofday()``, ``pipe()``, ``fork()``,
``signal()``, and ``select()`` (or ``poll()``).  Any of these should
be relatively straightforward to use (note that with ``read()`` and
``write()``, you'll need to open a file first - you can try to read
zero bytes from a file, or write zero bytes to ``/dev/null``, a
special "black hole" file).

When you have computed the average time for each of your two system
calls, write the average cost on the board (we'll create a big table).

 1. Demo/show your code to me

 2. Wait until we've discussed the results on the board


Example of using ``getttimeofday`` and ``rdtsc`` assembly call
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

An example using the ``gettimeofday`` system call for timestamping::

	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <sys/time.h>
	#include <time.h>

	int main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
	    struct timeval begin, end, diff;
	    gettimeofday(&begin, NULL);
	    gettimeofday(&end, NULL);
	    timersub(&end, &begin, &diff); // timersub is a macro defined in sys/time.h
	                                   // there's also timeradd and some others
	    printf("begin timestamp: %d.%06d\n", begin.tv_sec, begin.tv_usec);
	    printf("end timestamp  : %d.%06d\n", end.tv_sec, end.tv_usec);
	    printf("difference     : %d.%06d\n", diff.tv_sec, diff.tv_usec);
	    return 0;
	}

An example using the rdtsc assembly instruction for very high-precision timestamping::

	/* using the x86 cycle timer (rdtsc) to obtain a quasi-timestamp */
	#include <stdio.h>

	/* macro to use rdtsc assembly instruction */
	#define rdtscll(val) \
	     __asm__ __volatile__ ("rdtsc" : "=A" (val))

	int main(int argc, char **argv) 
	{
	    /* long long is a 64-bit integer */
	    long long begin = 0LL, end = 0LL, diff = 0LL;
	    rdtscll(begin);
	    rdtscll(end);
	    diff = end - begin;
	    printf("cycle timer begin: %lld\n", begin);
	    printf("cycle timer end  : %lld\n", end);
	    printf("difference       : %lld\n", diff);
	    return 0;
	}
